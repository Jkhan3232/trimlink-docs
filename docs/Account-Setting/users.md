# üîê User Permissions Configuration

The **User Permissions** section allows you to control access to various features of the application. Based on the assigned role (Admin or User), permissions can be toggled ON or OFF for each feature category.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Admin vs User Access

- **Admin**:

  - Has full access to all sections and features.
  - Can create, edit, delete users, domains, templates, links, and credentials.
  - Can view logs, manage permissions, and control API integrations.

- **User**:
  - Access is restricted by assigned permissions.
  - Only allowed to view or perform actions that are explicitly enabled.
